Desktop calculator design that applies the desired operations with the values received from the user

Hello everyone,

I share with you the first visual studio project of my software internship. I should point out that it is a task my manager has asked me to do. 
I am here with a desktop application that outputs the results of the operator selected with the values received from the user.

thank you,
Mustafa
